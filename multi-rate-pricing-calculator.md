# Take Home Assignment: Multi Rate Pricing Calculator

Estimated time: 6-8 hours

Role: Full Stack Developer (3-6 years experience)

## Overview

Build a small web application where users create documents with line items, apply per-line discounts and tax rules, compute totals correctly, and view a summary report for a date range.

This exercise tests careful numeric logic, document lifecycle management, and API validation patterns common in quotes, proposals, and billing tools. No tax compliance knowledge is required.

## Requirements

### 1. Authentication

Implement sign up and log in (email + password is sufficient).

Each user must only see and modify their own data.

### 2. Documents

Users create documents with:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Title | Document title |
| Customer | Customer name |
| Issue date | Date the document was issued |
| Status | `draft` or `finalized` |
| Line items | See below |

Each line item has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Description | Item or service name |
| Quantity | Number (>= 1) |
| Unit price | Price per unit (>= 0) |
| Discount | Optional - fixed amount or percent |
| Tax | Optional - percent applied to the line |

### 3. Calculations

Compute totals per line, then sum for the document.

Per line:

1. Line subtotal = quantity x unit price
2. Apply discount (fixed amount subtracted, or percent off subtotal - not both)
3. Apply tax percent on the discounted line amount
4. Line total = discounted amount + tax

Document totals:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Subtotal | Sum of (qty x unit price) before discounts |
| Total discount | Sum of all line discount amounts |
| Total tax | Sum of all line tax amounts |
| Grand total | Sum of all line totals |

Important:

- All totals must be computed server-side. The client must not be the source of truth.
- Pick a rounding policy, apply it consistently, and document it in the README.

### 4. Document lifecycle

| Status | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Fully editable - add, edit, remove lines |
| `finalized` | Read-only - no edits to lines, amounts, or metadata |

- Provide a way to finalize a draft document.
- Attempts to edit a finalized document must be rejected by the API with a clear error.
- Document whether users can duplicate a finalized document into a new draft as a stretch goal.

### 5. Summary report

Build a report filtered by issue date range showing:

- Number of documents
- Sum of grand totals
- Sum of total tax
- Sum of total discount

### 6. API

Expose a REST API.

- CRUD for documents and line items, respecting draft/finalized rules.
- Endpoint to finalize a document.
- Validation with specific error messages, for example invalid percent or negative quantity.

## Sample document

Use this to verify your calculations. Expected results below assume rounding to 2 decimal places per line for tax and totals.

| Line | Qty | Unit price | Discount | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WidgetA | 2 | 100.00 | 10% | 5% |
| WidgetB | 1 | 50.00 | - | 5% |
| Service fee | 1 | 200.00 | 20 fixed | - |

Per-line expected results:

| Line | Subtotal | Discount amount | After discount | Tax amount | Line total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WidgetA | 200.00 | 20.00 | 180.00 | 9.00 | 189.00 |
| WidgetB | 50.00 | 0.00 | 50.00 | 2.50 | 52.50 |
| Service fee | 200.00 | 20.00 | 180.00 | 0.00 | 180.00 |

Document expected totals:

| Field | Amount | How derived |
|---|---|---|
| Subtotal | 450.00 | 200 + 50 + 200 |
| Total discount | 40.00 | 20 + 0 + 20 |
| Total tax | 11.50 | 9.00 + 2.50 + 0 |
| Grand total | 421.50 | 189.00 + 52.50 + 180.00, or 450 - 40 + 11.50 |

Rules to confirm against this sample:

1. Discount is applied before tax.
2. Tax percent is applied on the discounted line amount.
3. A line may have percent discount or fixed discount, not both.
4. Fixed discount must not exceed that line's subtotal. Reject or clamp, but document your choice.
5. If you use a different rounding policy, document it and keep results internally consistent.

## Stretch goals

- Duplicate: copy a finalized document into a new draft.
- Finalize validation: reject finalize if any line has quantity <= 0 or negative prices.
- Printable view: HTML or PDF output of a document.

## Technical guidelines

- Stack: Your choice.
- Deployment: Required - include a live URL to a deployed version of the app.
- Tests: Unit tests on the calculation module are strongly appreciated.
- Money handling: Avoid floating-point drift. Use a strategy appropriate to your language, such as integer cents or a decimal library.

## Deliverables

Submit a Git repository containing:

1. Source code - backend, frontend, and any migrations/seed scripts.
2. Deployed live URL - a publicly accessible link to the running app.
3. README with:
   - Prerequisites and step-by-step setup
   - Calculation and rounding policy, with a worked example
   - Finalize and immutability rules
   - Assumptions and tradeoffs
   - What you would improve before production

The deployed URL should also be included in the submission email.

Optional: a short Loom/video walkthrough (5-10 minutes).

## What we evaluate

| Area | What we look for |
|---|---|
| Correctness | Line and document totals correct for mixed discount/tax |
| Calculation design | Single shared module; consistent rounding |
| Lifecycle | Finalized docs immutable via API |
| Validation | Specific errors for bad input |
| Reporting | Summary totals match individual documents in range |
| Tests | Calculation unit tests |
| Communication | README clarity, especially rounding policy |

## Questions?

If anything is ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption, document it in your README, and proceed.

Good luck - we look forward to reviewing your work.
